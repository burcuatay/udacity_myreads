# MyReads Project

This is the project 7 for the Udacity's Front End Development Nanodegree course. The goal of project is to understand the basics of React and how React works and behaves by creating a bookcase project.

## Description:
The user can organize their books on three shelves: *Currently Reading* *Want to Read* and *Read*. The books can change shelves depending on what the user chooses for each book. The user can also search for new books using the queries that are described in the [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) document and add them to their shelves. 

### Important:
The query in the [Search.js](Search.js) is case sensitive. So please make sure that you are using the exact matches of what's written on [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) when searching for queries.

## To get started:
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start server with `npm start`. This will open a browser widow with the application running on port `3000`
* Enjoy!

## Functionality:

### Changer.js:
Helps the user change the status of each book between the shelves *Currently Reading* *Want to Read* and *Read*.

### Book.js:
Renders the books within the bookshelves and search results

### Shelves.js:
Renders the shelves that the user has with the books in it.

### Search.js:
Searches for the books according to the query the user has written.
